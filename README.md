During the kharif season of 2017, cotton farmers across India lost large portions of their crop to a pest known as bollworms. Since then, farmers have been encouraged to install pheromone traps in their fields as part of a larger effort to control the problem. Pheromone traps capture male bollworms that are capable of reproducing. By counting the number of bollworms caught in such traps, farmers can estimate potential bollworm infestation to make informed decisions about whether pesticides should be applied to minimize future damage.

Wadhwani AI has developed a mobile app that allows farmers to take photographs of trap catches and receive recommendations based on machine-generated counts of pests in those images. To produce such counts, the app contains an object detection model trained to identify two types of bollworms.

Although the Wadhwani AI machine learning team has worked on this model for years, we are keen to explore new ideas for tackling the challenge. This competition is a step in that direction. The objective is to use our training data – data captured by farmers and farm extension workers since 2018 – to build models that accurately count the number of bollworms present in the image.
